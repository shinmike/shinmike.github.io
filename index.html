    <p class="f2 lh-title">Hello, my name is
      <b>Michael Shin</b>. I'm a junior full stack web developer based in Vancouver, BC. ðŸ‘‹
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>I'm passionate about creating meaningful web products with thoughtful user experiences.</b> I value design as much
      as functionality, and build with empathy.
    </p>

    <p>Currently, I'm a Front-End Developer at
      <a class="hover-black" href="https://ettrics.com/">Ettrics</a>, specializing in CMS-driven marketing websites. I've worked on highly customized JavaScript, jQuery, and
      CSS development for Webflow projects. Some projects I've worked on are:
      <a class="hover-black" href="https://ferolabs.com/">Fero Labs</a>,
      <a class="hover-black" href="https://assembly.com/">Assembly</a>, and
      <a class="hover-black" href="https://smartcar.com/">Smartcar</a>. 
    </p>
      
    <p>
      Before Ettrics, I was a Web Developer at 
      <a class="hover-black" href="https://routes.rungoapp.com/">RunGo</a>, a platform allowing users to create custom voice-navigated running routes. I worked particularly
      on improving user experience features for RunGoâ€™s Route Creator site. Highlights included creating a custom image overlay
      tool, improving print map, complete route tool, full screen edit mode, logbook integration with Strava API, and ensuring
      responsive design.
    </p>

    <p>In my spare time, I enjoy working on things that are personally interesting and challenging. Some side projects that
      I've collaborated on are:
      <li>
        <a class="hover-black" href="https://www.outofofficehours.com">Out of Office Hours</a>, a space for connecting tech mentees with tech mentors.</li>
      <li>
        <a href="#">Emily Curated Couples</a>, a fictitous dating website.</li>
    </p>

    <p>
      <mark>Iâ€™m currently taking on freelance web development work. If youâ€™d like to work together,
        <a class="hover-black" href="mailto:shinmike90@gmail.com">please get in touch</a>.
      </mark>
    </p>

    <p>
      Away from my computer, I can be found outside training for triathlons. Or in front of the TV watching reruns of The Office
      and Point Break for the tenth time.
    </p>

    <p>If youâ€™d like to chat, feel free to send me an
      <a class="hover-black" href="mailto:shinmike90@gmail.com">email</a>.
